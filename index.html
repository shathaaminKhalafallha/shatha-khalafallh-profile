                <p>
                   

                        I am shatha khalafallh, I studied computer engineering at the Islamic University and Junior
                         FrontEnd Web Developer with a passion for learning and creating. I am currently working on my portfolio
                          as part of my coding academy participation.

                I have always believed in my role as an individual in society and
                 that I should explore all the energy stored within me and use it for the benefit of society,
                  and I have always had a passion for entering the world of programming.
                   I would like to participate in this training so that it broadens my horizons in a field 
                   I have always loved, and gives me a great opportunity to participate more in the labor market and to get 
                   a job opportunity and reach as many of my ambitions as possible. As far as possible in the programming world.
                    Also, my entry into the academy will give me a strong opportunity to get to know and connect with my fellow programmers
                     and designers and maintain relationships so that we will have a joint business soon.
